# TLR Identification and Ontogenetic/Tissue-specific Expression Analysis in *Pleurodeles waltl*

This repository documents the full annotation and expression analysis of Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes in the Iberian ribbed newt (*Pleurodeles waltl*), conducted as part of a bachelor’s thesis in evolutionary immunogenomics.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To identify the TLR genes in the *Pleurodeles waltl* genome, and to quantify their expression across developmental stages and bodyparts' tissues using RNA-seq data and TPM/FPKM based estimation.

## ❓ Hypothesis

I hypothesise elevated general TLR and particularly fish-type TLRs expression in early, aquatic larval stage in *P. waltl*, showing retained aquatic immune strategy.

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

The analysis was conducted in R using RStudio, terminal tools and external programs. The scripts and steps done in R are reproducible.

### 1. **TLR Gene Annotation**  
See: [`anot.Rmd`](./anot.Rmd)  
- BLAST-p search using *Lissotriton* TLR proteins  
- Parsing top hits (E=0, highest bit score), linking to gene IDs from `.gtf`  
- Generation of a filtered annotation table

### 2. **Multiple-sequence alignment for particular TLR genes**  
See: [`anot.Rmd`](./anot.Rmd)  
- BLAST-p search using *Lissotriton* TLR proteins  
- Parsing top hits (E=0), linking to gene IDs from `.gtf`  
- Generation of a filtered annotation table

### 3. **Expression Quantification**  
See: [`exp.Rmd`](./exp.Rmd)  
- RNA-seq alignment (paired-end)  
- Quantification with `featureCounts` using CDS features  
- Normalization to TPM-like and FPKM values  
- Sample classification into developmental groups

### 4. **Data Visualization**
See: [`exp.Rmd`](./exp.Rmd)
- TPM-based relative expression plotted per gene and stage
- TPM-based relative expression plotted per gene, stage and tissue for fish-type TLRs
- FPKM-based global expression for each developmental group
