# E-value = 0 sorting

```{r}
anot1 <- subset(tlr_1, V11 == 0.0)
```

Only records with e-value equal to 0 were selected by subseting the V11 column.

# Highest subject bitscore

```{r}
library(dplyr)

anot2 <- anot1 %>%
  group_by(V2) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = V12, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE) %>%
  ungroup()
```

For the each individual subject the highest bitscore was selected:

# anot4_1

Cleaning from irrelevant naming:

```{r}
anot4_1$gene_id <- gsub("GeneID:", "", anot4_1$gene_id)
anot4_1$subject <- gsub("GenBank:", "", anot4_1$subject)
```

**Adding quary name (TLR) as a column:**

```{r}
anot2_1 <- anot2 %>% select(name, prot_id)
anot5 <- anot4_1 %>%
  left_join(anot2_1, by = "prot_id")
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(anot5)
```

**And additionaly with the bitscore:**

```{r}
anot2_1_1 <- anot2 %>% select(name, prot_id, bit_score)
anot5_bitscore <- anot4_1 %>%
  left_join(anot2_1_1, by = "prot_id")

```
